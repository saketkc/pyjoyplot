# pyjoyplot
POC for a 'joyplot' using matplotlib.

Inspired from [Henrik Lindberg's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/6m0wo7/peak_time_for_sports_and_leisure_oc/djy1i3h/) and his original [code](https://github.com/halhen/viz-pub/blob/master/sports-time-of-day/2_gen_chart.R) in R.

See [notebook](pyjoyplot.ipynb)
